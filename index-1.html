<h3 id="isa">ISA:</h3>
<p>The main module of the core. It has the following communication ports:
- <em>blocking_out<CPtoME_IF> toMemoryPort</em> used for, request a read instruction, request a read data for load instructions and request a write data for store instructions.
- <em>blocking_in<MEtoCP_IF> fromMemoryPort</em> used for, read instruction and read data for load instructions.
- <em>master_in<RegfileType> fromRegsPort</em> used for reading the register file.
- <em>master_out<RegfileWriteType> toRegsPort</em> used for writing back to the register file.
- <em>blocking_out<bool> isa_syscall_Port</em> used for triggering the SYScallHandler when an <strong>ECALL</strong> is read.
- <em>blocking_in<bool> syscall_isa_Port</em> used for reading the status of the processor after <strong>ECALL</strong>.
- <em>master_in<unsigned int> mip_isa_Port</em> used for reading the status of the connected interrupt sources.</p>
<p>It splits the instruction processing to two stages, fetch and execute.
- <strong>Fetch:</strong> Happens through a Blocking communication (Write request then Read instruction) with the Memory.
- <strong>Execute:</strong> Depending on the instruction decoded, this can have different communications stages,</p>

<h3 id="core-local-interruptor-clint">Core Local Interruptor (CLINT):</h3>
<p>This module is used to generate software and timer Interrupts. It contains the RISC-V msip, mtime and mtimecmp memory mapped CSRs.
The msip memory mapped CSR can be used to generate Machine Software Interrupts (MSIP). This register can be accessed by remote harts to provide machine-mode
interprocessor interrupt (Not included in our current implementation).
mtime and mtimecmp memory mapped CSRs can be used to generate Machine Timer Interrupts (MTIP). This interrupt is set when mtime exceed mtimecmp and it can be reset by
writing a new bigger value to mtimecmp.
This module has the following communication ports:
- <em>blocking_in<CPtoME_IF> COtoME_port</em> used for reading memory access requests from the InnerCore.

<p>Adding new Peripherals will require adding two new communication ports to this module and manage the linking at the Core level.</p>
<h3 id="core">Core:</h3>
<p>This module represent a Top model for the previously mentioned modules (InnerCore, CLINT, PLIC and Bus) and it forwards the Memory connections outward of the Core for
consistency purposes with other RISCV implementations presented in this project. It has the following communication ports:
- <em>blocking_out<CPtoME_IF> COtoME_port</em> used for forwarding the memory access request out of Core.
- <em>blocking_in<MEtoCP_IF> MEtoCO_port</em> used for forwarding the memory reply to the internal modules of the Core.</p>
<h1 id="register-transfer-level-rtl">Register Transfer Level (RTL):</h1>
<p>Most of the ESL modules of the RISCV-Interrupt processor have been designed following SystemC-PPA methodology (revisit SCAM Manual for more information about
SystemC-PPA), with the exception of CLINT, PLIC and Memory which are considered as environmental components and not as parts of the main core or the RISCV processor.
Starting from these ESL modules, a complete set of ITL properties have been generated for each subModule using <strong>SCAM</strong> tool and later the RTL design of these subModules
have been created while guaranteeing that the properties are holding. The only refinement needed of the properties was to modify the macros to match the RTL naming for
ports and signals. No timing refinement was needed because this RISCV processor implementation was designed with single cycle processes.</p>
<p>The RTL directory includes the VHDL implementation of the Core and the set of ITL properties.</p>
<h1 id="examples">Examples:</h1>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
<li>In order to generated elf or hex programs for these examples you need to have a functioning RISCV compiler.
For more details about this look at the RISCV Compiler section.</li>
<li>
<p>To make sure no mixing happens while generating the programs, add to your .bashrc file the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>export RISCV_XLEN=32
export RISCV_LIB=elf
export RISCV=/opt/riscv32i
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to run elf programs on this processor you need to have Boost library installed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="freertos">FreeRTOS:</h3>
<p>You can download this example from (https://github.com/illustris/FreeRTOS-RISCV).
The only functional change required to run this example on our processor is to modify the <strong>configTICK_CLOCK_HZ</strong> in (FreeRTOS/Demo/riscv-spike/conf/FreeRTOSConfig.h)
for timing purposes.
Another architectural change is required to insure consistency between our implementation's definition of Memory's addressing space and FreeRTOS addressing space,
this change happens at (FreeRTOS/Demo/riscv-spike/arch/link.ld):</p>
<pre><code>MEMORY {
    imem : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 0x00020000
    dmem : ORIGIN = 0x00020000, LENGTH = 0x00020000
}
</code></pre>
<p>In order to preserve consistency between all examples, regarding addressing space and used libraries, the architecture of the FreeRTOS example is used in all other
examples and only minor changes happen regarding interrupt handlers in the (arch/boot.S) file.</p>
<h3 id="printmessage">PrintMessage:</h3>
<p>This example has been constructed to test the functionality of the SYScallHandler be using the "printf" function in the program which triggers a syscall.
No interrupt has been enabled in this example.</p>
<h3 id="timer">Timer:</h3>
<p>This example has been constructed to test the functionality of the interrupt handling and interrupt triggering by CLINT.
Only timer interrupt has been enabled in this example.</p>
<h3 id="tempsensor">TempSensor:</h3>
<p>This example has been constructed to test the functionality of the interrupt handling and prioritizing when two interrupt are being triggered. Timer interrupt and Local
interrupt, with local interrupt having a higher priority than timer interrupt.</p>
<p>The local interrupt source (Peripherals/CoreTempSensor) issues an interrupt when the current Temperature (Tcur) passes a certain threshold value (Tthreshold). The randomness of the
temperature value is being handled using SCV library. In order to incorporate the CoreTempSensor in the processor you should uncomment its pragma from Core:</p>
<pre><code>//#define CoreTempSensor_ON
</code></pre>
<p>All local0, external, timer and software interrupts have been enabled in this example but only local0 and timer will be really active.</p>
<h2 id="riscv-compiler">RISCV Compiler</h2>
<p>You can download RISCV compiler from this link:
    https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32#building-a-pure-rv32i-toolchain</p>
<p>The default settings in the riscv-tools build scripts will build a compiler,
assembler and linker that can target any RISC-V ISA, but the libraries are built
for RV32G and RV64G targets. Follow the instructions below to build a complete toolchain
(including libraries) that target a pure RV32I CPU.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu packages needed:<pre><code>sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev \
libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo \
gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev git
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following commands will build the RISC-V GNU toolchain and libraries for a pure RV32I target,
and install it in /opt/riscv32i:</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir /opt/riscv32i
sudo chown $USER /opt/riscv32i

git clone https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain riscv-gnu-toolchain-rv32i
cd riscv-gnu-toolchain-rv32i
git checkout 1b80cbe
git submodule update --init --recursive

./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv32i --with-arch=rv32i --with-abi=ilp32
make -j$(nproc)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: don't forget to add /opt/riscv32i/bin to your PATH variable in your .bashrc file</p>
<p>The commands will all be named using the prefix riscv32-unknown-elf-, which makes it
easy to install them side-by-side with the regular riscv-tools (those are using the name
prefix riscv64-unknown-elf- by default).</p>
